              Stephen Christopher Sanchez (born November 3, 2002) is an American
              singer-songwriter. Based in Nashville, Sanchez released his debut
              extended play What Was, Not Now in October 2021. On September 1,
              2021, Sanchez released the single "Until I Found You", which
              peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 8 on the Australian
              ARIA Chart and No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sanchez's style is very reminiscent of music from the 1950s and
              1960s, which is an era of music he has cited heavily influenced
              him from a young age. His song "Evangeline", released in 2023,
              contains a sample from Bobby Goldsboro's "Honey", released in
              1968.
