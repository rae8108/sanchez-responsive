            <p>
              Stephen Christopher Sanchez (born November 3, 2002) is an American
              singer-songwriter. Based in Nashville, Sanchez released his debut
              extended play What Was, Not Now in October 2021. On September 1,
              2021, Sanchez released the single "Until I Found You", which
              peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 8 on the Australian
              ARIA Chart and No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sanchez's style is very reminiscent of music from the 1950s and
              1960s, which is an era of music he has cited heavily influenced
              him from a young age. His song "Evangeline", released in 2023,
              contains a sample from Bobby Goldsboro's "Honey", released in
              1968.

                Hold Her While You Can is a song by Stephen Sanchez and is the

              <p>
                The song tells the story of a man who loves his girlfriend and
                knows that time is precious. He cherishes every moment with her,
                knowing that one day they will not have the chance to be
                together. He encourages others to do the same and enjoy the time
                they spend with their loved ones. Even when he is old and alone,
                he remembers the love he shared with his partner and holds on to
                that memory.

              <h4>Until I Found You</h4>
              <p>
                Until I Found You is a song by Stephen Sanchez and is the sixth
                track on his debut album Angel Face; and the seventh track from
                his Easy On My Eyes EP.

              <h5>About</h5>
              <p>
                The song stands out by being a 1950's-inspired love song with
                old-school charm[1] and bluesy instrumentals creating a swing
                rhythm. The song went 3x Platinum in the USA (RIAA). Lyrically
                described as "Sanchez [wearing] his heart on his sleeve", and "a
                whimsically beautiful love song that causes you to yearn for a
                time and a love that you never got to experience".
              </p>

              <h4>Evangeline</h4>
              <p>
                Evangeline is a song by Stephen Sanchez and is the second track
                on his debut album Angel Face.
              </p>
              <h5>Release</h5>
              <p>25 January 2023</p>
              <h5>About</h5>
              <p>
                "Evangeline" plays a part in the album's larger love story arc,
                as the album tells the love stories of many different characters
                between two distinct years. Here, it is about the titular
                character of Evangeline and The Troubadour Sanchez in 1964. This
                song is about being completely smitten by someone (Evangeline),
                but acknowledging that they may not be as eager to fall in love
                as you are, but you promise them comfort if they fully give you
                their heart. Overall, it's a heartfelt ode to true love and the
                lengths that the narrator is willing to go to keep them safe and
                comfortable.
